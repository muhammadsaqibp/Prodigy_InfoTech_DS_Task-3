Bank Marketing Decision Tree Classifier
Welcome to my repository for the decision tree classifier project, a key component of my Data Science Internship. In this project, I built a decision tree model to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data, using the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Overview
The main goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that identifies customers likely to subscribe to a product. By analyzing customer demographics and previous marketing interactions, the model helps financial institutions optimize their marketing strategies and improve campaign outcomes.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the "Bank Marketing" dataset, which contains records from direct marketing campaigns carried out by a Portuguese banking institution. Key features include:

Demographic Information: Age, job, marital status, and education.
Contact Details: Communication type, day of week, and campaign duration.
Campaign History: Number of contacts, previous outcomes, and more.
Target Variable: Indicates whether a customer subscribed (yes/no).
The dataset can be found on the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Methodology
Data Preprocessing
Cleaning: Checked for and addressed missing values and duplicates.
Label Encoding: Converted categorical variables to numerical values using label encoding, which facilitates analysis and model training.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): A correlation heatmap was generated to inspect relationships between numeric features.
Model Development
Decision Tree Classifier:
The classifier was trained to predict customer subscription behavior.
The target variable was transformed to a binary format (1 for subscription, 0 for non-subscription).
Model Evaluation:
Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were calculated.
The decision tree was visualized to interpret the decision rules.
Results
The decision tree model effectively identifies key factors that influence whether a customer will subscribe. The visualized tree highlights decision splits based on features such as demographic information and campaign interactions, offering clear insights into the prediction process.

Key outcomes include:

Satisfactory Accuracy: The model shows reliable performance on unseen data.
Interpretability: The decision tree structure makes it easy to understand which features drive customer behavior.
Actionable Insights: The model can help refine targeting strategies for future marketing campaigns.
Conclusion
This project demonstrates the power of machine learning in predicting customer behavior. By using a decision tree classifier on the Bank Marketing dataset, I have created a model that can guide marketing efforts, ultimately enhancing customer engagement and campaign efficiency.

Thank you for reviewing my submission!
